# Example App

This project shows a very simple web app integration. The app primarily consists of two files:

* `install.php` This file forwards the user to the screen on which the user has to grant permissions to the web app.
* `confirm.php` The confirm script checks that the incoming request is legit and confirms afterwards the installation with the code returned in the request.
